# Difference between C and C++

In this article, I discuss the differences between C and C++. Both are great programming languages, each with its unique strengths and use cases. Below, I share a brief overview of the key differences between them.

When it comes to coding, C and C++ are like siblings - they share some traits, but they're also pretty different. 

## Origin 

- C was created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. It was designed as a general-purpose, procedural programming language with a focus on system programming and low-level manipulation.

- On the other hand, C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup. C++ was conceived as an extension of C, incorporating the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) while retaining compatibility with C code. 
## Programming 
 
One of the most significant distinctions between C and C++ lies in their programming paradigms. 

- C is primarily a procedural programming language, where programs are organized around functions or procedures.

- In contrast, C++ is both procedural and object-oriented programming language. It introduces concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. 
## Memory Management

Memory management is another area where C and C++ diverge significantly.

- In C, memory allocation and deallocation are handled explicitly by the programmer using functions like `malloc()` and `free()`. While this level of control offers flexibility, it also opens the door to memory leaks and segmentation faults if mismanaged.

- C++, on the other hand, introduces the concept of constructors and destructors, along with dynamic memory allocation operators `new` and `delete`. 
- Additionally, C++ provides smart pointers like `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`, which automate memory management and help mitigate common pitfalls associated with manual memory allocation.
##  Standard Libraries and Features

Both C and C++ come with standard libraries that provide essential functions and data types for common programming tasks. However, C++ expands upon the C standard library, incorporating additional features tailored to its object-oriented nature.
C++ introduces features like templates, exception handling, namespaces, and the Standard Template Library (STL), which offers a rich collection of generic algorithms and containers.
These features enhance code readability, maintainability, and reusability, fostering a more productive development experience compared to C.
## Examples

Below is a "Hello, world" progam written in C and C++

### C Program:
```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
``` 
### C++ program:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
## conclusion

In conclusion, while C and C++ share a common heritage and syntax, they diverge in significant ways that reflect their respective design philosophies and intended use cases. C excels in system programming and performance-critical applications, offering precise control over hardware resources. On the other hand, C++ embraces the modern software development paradigm, providing a rich set of features for building robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems.
