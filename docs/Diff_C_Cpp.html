            <p>In this article, I discuss the differences between C and C++. Both are great programming languages, each with its unique strengths and use cases. Below, I share a brief overview of the key differences between them.</p>
            <p>When it comes to coding, C and C++ are like siblings - they share some traits, but they're also pretty different.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="origin article">
            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>C was created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. It was designed as a general-purpose, procedural programming language with a focus on system programming and low-level manipulation.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup. C++ was conceived as an extension of C, incorporating the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) while retaining compatibility with C code.</p>

        <section class="programming-paradigm article">
            <h2>Programming Paradigms</h2>
            <p>One of the most significant distinctions between C and C++ lies in their programming paradigms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C is primarily a procedural programming language, where programs are organized around functions or procedures.</li>
                <li>In contrast, C++ is both a procedural and object-oriented programming language. It introduces concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="memory-management article">
            <h2>Memory Management</h2>
            <p>Memory management is another area where C and C++ diverge significantly.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In C, memory allocation and deallocation are handled explicitly by the programmer using functions like <code>malloc()</code> and <code>free()</code>. While this level of control offers flexibility, it also opens the door to memory leaks and segmentation faults if mismanaged.</li>
                <li>C++, on the other hand, introduces the concept of constructors and destructors, along with dynamic memory allocation operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>.</li>
                <li>Additionally, C++ provides smart pointers like <code>std::unique_ptr</code> and <code>std::shared_ptr</code>, which automate memory management and help mitigate common pitfalls associated with manual memory allocation.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="libs-support article">
            <h2>Standard Libraries and Features</h2>
            <p>Both C and C++ come with standard libraries that provide essential functions and data types for common programming tasks. However, C++ expands upon the C standard library, incorporating additional features tailored to its object-oriented nature.</p>
            <p>C++ introduces features like templates, exception handling, namespaces, and the Standard Template Library (STL), which offers a rich collection of generic algorithms and containers.</p>
            <p>These features enhance code readability, maintainability, and reusability, fostering a more productive development experience compared to C.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="examples article">
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>Below is a "Hello, World!" program written in C and C++.</p>
            <h3>C Program</h3>
            <pre><code>#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
            <h3>C++ Program</h3>
            <pre><code>#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section class="conclusion article">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, while C and C++ share a common heritage and syntax, they diverge in significant ways that reflect their respective design philosophies and intended use cases. C excels in system programming and performance-critical applications, offering precise control over hardware resources. On the other hand, C++ embraces the modern software development paradigm, providing a rich set of features for building robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems.</p>
